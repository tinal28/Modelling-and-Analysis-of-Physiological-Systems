# Modelling-and-Analysis-of-Physiological-Systems
This repository includes all the files for modeling and analysis of physiological systems as follows.

## 1. Analysis of cardiac physiology
Examine the complexities of the heart's functioning through the use of simulation software. Delve into aspects like regular heartbeats, the speed of blood flow, pressure changes throughout the cardiac cycle, and other relevant factors. Explore how valves in the heart function, study the phases of diastolic filling, and analyze the patterns of blood flow. Employ simulation data to gain insights into the physiological processes that occur during each cycle of the heart.
